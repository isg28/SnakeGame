# SnakeGame
The Snake Game is a video game that enables users to control a snake, which moves around a bordered area, consuming food to grow. The objective is to continuously expand the snake's tail. However, there are two main challenges: avoiding collisions with the snake's own tail and staying within the borders, both of which lead to a game over.

For our CSC133 course, our goal is to enhance efficiency and minimize code smells in the Snake Game from 'Learning Java by Building Android Games', published by Packt. 
We plan to incorporate fundamental concepts such as object-oriented programming, refactoring techniques, and interfaces.
